    HI! I'm Emm, an amatuer coder and cartoonist! my pronouns are she/her and I'm 24 years old. I'm happily married and have three lovely cats: Weyland, Newt and Wyrm. I've been learning about web developement and honing my skills over the past few months with a particular interest in front end developement and graphic design.
    Getting a page to look spick and span while adding a playful pop to my projects is what I enjoy most! This is true of my art as well which I've been creating for 10+ years. putting a creative spin on anything I work on is my passion! feel free to look at my portfolio tab for examples of both my coding and art.
    Aditionally I enjoy writting, video games and board games and all sorts of media. I enjoy meandering between genres when consuming media which means I watch anything from star wars, bungo stray dogs, game of thrones, steven universe to top ten creepiest caught on camera compolations. Pretty much a mixed bag when it comes to interests! This is true of music as well but some of my favorite artists currently are Aurora,  King Mala and the Crane wives, though I tend to listen to all sorts of music and am always looking for new jams. if you have any suggestions feel free to get in touch with me by checking out my contact page.
